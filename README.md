# AdminBar plugin for CakeAdmin and CakePHP

This plugin generates an easy-to-use admin-bar on top of your application when you are logged in as administrator.

> Note: This is a non-stable plugin for CakePHP 3.x at this time. It is currently under development and should be 
considered experimental.

## Installation
You can install this plugin into your CakePHP application using composer.

The recommended way to install composer packages is:

    composer require cakemanager/cakeadmin-adminbar:dev-master
    
Now load the plugin with the command:

    $ bin/cake plugin load -r -b AdminBar

## Settings
You can activate or deactivate the AdminBar in the settings-page in the backend.
